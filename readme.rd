You are tasked with designing a vehicle rental system.
The system has to manage different types of vehicles (cars, trucks and motorcycles).
It also needs to save information about customers who rent these vehicles.

Vehicle information:

license plate
colour
price per day

Customer information:
    Name
    Address
    Age

When designing this system, have in mind the features that the users will need:
    check if the vehicle is currently free or rented out
    calculate total rental price for the customer
    get a list of max last 5 rentals per vehicle

To submit the exercise, please insert the link to the GitHub repository.
